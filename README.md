⚠️ Note: I am currently evaluating the functionality of the Ludo game webpage developed by CC Group 'A' students.

🛠️ Issue: The tokens in the game are not moving forward correctly despite the dice rolling functionality working as intended.

Here's the issue description with appropriate emojis:

🛑 1 ) : Token Disappearance and Loop in Game

When a token is unlocked, it is visible at the starting position. However, after rolling any number 🎲 and moving the token, it disappears. This leads to a loop 🔄 where the same player continuously rolls the dice without progressing in the game.

💡 Objective:

To identify and resolve the code-related issues preventing the tokens from moving appropriately based on the dice rolls.
🗂️ Project Structure Update:
I have implemented a new folder structure to enhance the organization of the project files and to make this github page functional. Below is the updated tree structure for clarity:

## 📜 Old Structure
 Ludo Game/ └───Audio/ 🎵 └───Game Code/ 💻 └───Images/ 🖼️


## 🔄 New Structure
  Ludo Game/ ├───Audio/ 🎵 ├───css/ 🎨 ├───Images/ 🖼️ └───js/ 📜 └───index.html 🗂️

## ✨ Summary
- **Audio**: Contains all sound files for the game. 
- **CSS**: Folder for stylesheets to make the game visually appealing. 
- **Images**: All image files used in the game are stored here. 
- **JavaScript**: Contains the main game logic and functionality. 
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that brings everything together.
